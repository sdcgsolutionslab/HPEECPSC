    "The dataset is based on the 2019 New York City yellow cab trip data (approximately 375,000 trip records from January-June 2019). The dataset has many different properties (aka _\"X - features\"_) like the pickup time and location, the dropoff time and location, the trip distance, the number of passengers, and several other variables. The goal is to predict the taxi ride duration in NY City (the target aka _\"Y - label\"_) based on these features. \n",
